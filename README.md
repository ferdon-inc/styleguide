# Ferdon Style Guides

Every major project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project
([Ferdon/styleguide](https://github.com/tuvalusoftware/styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for Ferdon code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Ferdon, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.

This project holds the [Java Style Guide][java], [HTML/CSS Style Guide][htmlcss], [JavaScript Style Guide][js].

<!-- There are some style guide which we have not implement yet [C++ Style Guide][cpp], [C# Style Guide][csharp],
[Swift Style Guide][swift], [Objective-C Style Guide][objc], [Python Style Guide][py], [R Style Guide][r], [Shell Style Guide][sh], [AngularJS Style Guide][angular],
[Common Lisp Style Guide][cl], and [Vimscript Style Guide][vim]. This project
also contains [cpplint][cpplint], a tool to assist with style guide compliance,
and [google-c-style.el][emacs], an Emacs settings file for Google style. -->

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the [XML
Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be helpful. In addition to actual style
rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing
format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.
